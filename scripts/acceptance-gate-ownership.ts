/**
 * Focused compiler contracts that acceptance, rather than an outer CI wrapper,
 * owns.
 *
 * Why: these tests previously ran only from the release-oriented `test:ci`
 * command. The normal stable pull-request job calls `test:acceptance`
 * directly, so regressions in module-function emission or strict array reads
 * could reach main before the focused test ran.
 *
 * What/How: `test-acceptance.ts` executes this list exactly once. The
 * validation below rejects a second direct invocation from `test:ci` or either
 * GitHub workflow. Standalone focused commands remain available for iteration.
