We do not publish to npm and do not execute the npm CLI as part of our test pipeline; this package is only present in the devDependency tree and is scanned in CI via `yarn test:vulns`. OSV currently reports no fixed version for the flagged advisory (CVE-2026-0775), so we allowlist it temporarily while monitoring for upstream updates."
